## Project overview
This project explores the impact and potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing the healthcare industry. Using OpenAI and Ollama, this blog post delves into how advanced AI models can reshape healthcare\ delivery, improve patient outcomes, and optimize operational efficiency. The content provides insights into the future of AI in healthcare, backed by real-world applications and emerging trends in medical technology.

## Project Goal 
	•	To explore how AI, particularly models like OpenAI and Ollama, is transforming the healthcare landscape.
	•	To discuss the various ways AI is enhancing patient care, streamlining administrative processes, and advancing medical research.
	•	To offer insights into the challenges and ethical considerations surrounding AI adoption in health
 ## Technologies used
 	•	OpenAI: Utilized for natural language processing and advanced machine learning capabilities to generate content and automate medical insights.
	•	Ollama: A platform to integrate and deploy various large language models, allowing for efficient healthcare-specific applications, such as clinical decision support and patient query handling.
 


## Installation and Setup
	•	Python 3.11 or higher
	•	Install OpenAI and Ollama libraries
  pip install openai
   pip install ollama

## Configuration
	1.	OpenAI API Setup: You need an API key from OpenAI. Create an account and get your API key at OpenAI API. Set up your environment variables:
        .	 export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

  2.	Ollama Setup: Download and install Ollama from the official website or GitHub repository: Ollama Installation Guide Ensure Ollama’s model registry is set up.
  import openai
  import ollama
